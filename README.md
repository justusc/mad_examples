mad_examples
============

Task-based parallel program examples using MADNESS parallel runtime. You can download MADNESS from http://code.google.com/p/m-a-d-n-e-s-s/.

The examples include:

* **hello.cc** - A "Hello World" program using MADNESS
* **axpy.cc** - Compute the vector `y[i] = A*x[i] + y[i]`
* **fib.cc** - A Fibonacci number calculator
* **reduce.cc** - A reduction algorithm
 
Note: These programs are not models for effiency, they are simple examples of how to use the MADNESS parallel runtime.
